    *** Add the <DbContect> Srrvice to the Application

    Adding the <DbContext> to the application as a Service
    1. We need to access the <DbContect> from the <Persistence> project folder from this <API> project. But we are currently is in API project folder. 
    2. We already added the Entity Framework into the <API> project. So we need to "Transitive"(Transfer) these Entity Framework dependency from this application <API> project to the <Persistence> project
    3. We need to execute the <Dotnet restore> command at the solution level to make the Entity framework available from the <API> project to the <Persistence> project.
    4. Open up a new terminal at the main solution folder, which is the <WeatherAPI> folder
    PS D:\App w .Net Core and React\WeatherAPI>
    5. Type in the commans <dotnet restore>
    PS D:\App w .Net Core and React\WeatherAPI> dotnet restore
    Determining projects to restore...
    All projects are up-to-date for restore.
    PS D:\App w .Net Core and React\WeatherAPI> 
    This should make the Entity Framework available for both <API> and <Persistence> project
    6. How to add the <DbContect> Service?
    a. Auto complete help for <builder.Services.AddDbContext>
    b. Add the class name of the database <DataContext>
    c. Add the parameter for the database. using the lamda expression for the option. Just follow the convention starting with "opt =>". Write the implementation code into the curly braces starting with <opt.>
    d. then select the <UseSqlite> from the auto complete dropdown option.
    e. pass in the database connection with the help of the auto complete starting with "builder" => opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString()
    f. Pass in a variable name for the database connection string. The commonly use variable name is "DefaultConnection"
    g. The completed command code for adding the <DbContext> database Service is as below: 
    builder.Services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(opt => {
    opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
    7. Where do we declare our Database connection string?
    We declare the SQLite database connection string in the <appsettings.Development.json> as a key value pair as show below:
      "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=weatherapi.db"
    }
    });
    "ConnectionStrings" => indicate it's a database connection string
    "DefaultConnection" => is the variable name we define here as a service for the database connection string
    "Data Source=weatherapi.db" => this is the actual SQLite database connection string. SQLite store data in the form of a file with an extension ".db". We declare a file name <weatherapi.db> for this SQLite database
*/
builder.Services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(opt => {
    opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
});

/*
    "Database Creation" process will be coded here
    The "Database Creation" process will create the database if it doesn;t exist or update the database base on the current Migration which have been done completed befor this is possible.

    We need the dependency from the "DataContext Services" which we have added to this <API> project at the top as shoe below:

    builder.Services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(opt => {
        opt.UseSqlite(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));
    });

    We be using the dependency injection method such that this <Program.cs> can access to it. But we do not the <Denpency Injection> in this <Program.cs> but we still need to get access to the <DataContext> Service.

    23. Start coding the "Database Creation"
    using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
    <using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();> means we are creating a scope using the <CreateScope()> for accessing the Services. If the process completed, this particular method <CreateScope()> anything within this this "scope" will going to be dispose or destroy clean up the memory for this "scope" execution. This is a good practice for a programmmer to dispose off any unuse object. Actually the the Garbage Collector will do the same task for us if we just ignore it so this is not really a problem.
    Basically we are creating a "scope" for accessing a service 

    24. Actually all the listed services are going to be "scoped" to the HTTP request that comes into this <API> application. 
    Whenever the <API> application received a HTTP request, it will create services and get access to a services then can access to the databse to make a query against it. 
    Basically when this <API> application received a HTTP request, it will create an instance of the <DataContext> service and then get acess to query the database.
    When the HTTP request have been done, then this particular instance of <DataContext> will be dispose from the memory of the system.

    In summary we will create a "scope" <app.Services.CreateScope()> to access to the a Service
